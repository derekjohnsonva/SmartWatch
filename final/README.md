# Final Project

This is the code that we created to verify our implementation of BPM 
detection would work. 
Inside of the `data` directory are some sample runs created by conducting at
80 and 100 BPM. They are labeled appropriately.

In order to run the code, simply call
```shell
python3 fouriertest.py
```
This will generate the FFT and acceleration graphs as well as give you a predicted BPM
